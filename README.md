#Real-time document editor

#Instructions 

Give Glitch.com around 30 seconds for the web app to start up. Open two seperate browser windows/tabs and login in with any username. Start typing and watch the text be updated in real-time on all connected users. To reset the app just log out from all connected users.

Happy editing!!

#Technologies used 

React and redux for state management. Bootstrap for grid and quick styling. Websockets for real-time communication. I hope you like it.
